## Introduction

Adolescence, defined by the WHO, the phase between childhood and adulthood (ages 10-19), is a critical stage for establishing personal hygiene habits. For adolescent girls, the onset of menarche represents a significant physiological change, necessitating appropriate education and counseling on menstrual hygiene and health. The WHO further explains that menstrual health and hygiene (MHH) encompasses broader factors that link menstruation with health, well-being, gender equality, education, empowerment, and rights. These systemic factors are underscored by UNESCO, which emphasizes the importance of accurate education, access to safe and affordable menstrual products, professional guidance, proper sanitation facilities, and supportive social norms 1, 2.

However, menstrual hygiene management (MHM) remains a significant challenge in low-income countries, including Pakistan, where many adolescent girls in sub-urban and rural areas face barriers in maintaining proper hygiene. These challenges are linked to inadequate education, cultural taboos, and limited access to menstrual hygiene products and sanitation facilities. Research from Ethiopia and Nepal has shown that many girls enter puberty without adequate preparation, often due to a lack of prior knowledge and cultural stigmas surrounding menstruation. This lack of education increases the risk of unhygienic practices, leading to health complications such as reproductive tract infections 4, 5. Similarly, in Pakistan, adolescent girls, especially in sub-urban areas, often face stigma and shame surrounding menstruation, preventing open discussion, and reinforcing misconceptions. This, in turn, hinders their ability to manage menstrual health effectively, leading to school absenteeism, poor academic performance, and even school drop-out in some cases 7.

The situation is further complicated by socio-economic factors. Many families in lower-income areas struggle to provide necessary resources for menstrual hygiene, including sanitary pads, soap, water, and proper disposal facilities. Studies in urban slum areas of Pakistan have shown that menstrual hygiene practices are heavily influenced by family income, maternal education, and access to sanitation facilities 9. These socio-economic challenges exacerbate the difficulties faced by adolescent girls in managing their menstrual health.

Given these challenges, comprehensive educational interventions and policy changes are urgently needed. Addressing the menstrual hygiene needs of adolescent girls in Pakistan, particularly in sub-urban and rural areas, is crucial to ensuring their health, dignity, and continued education. This paper emphasizes the importance of assessing menstrual hygiene awareness in adolescent girls, particularly exploring the influence of maternal education on their knowledge and practices in sub-urban areas of Pakistan. Integrating menstrual hygiene education into school curricula and health education programs is essential to reduce stigma and improve the quality of life for adolescent girls.

## Rationale

Menstruation, though a natural physiological process, is often clouded by cultural taboos and misconceptions, particularly in low-income regions. This study examines the challenges adolescent girls in sub-urban Pakistan face in managing menstrual hygiene, where cultural barriers, limited resources, and poor sanitation infrastructure exacerbate the issue. Focusing on the impact of maternal education, the research explores how well-educated mothers can influence their daughters' knowledge and practices regarding menstrual hygiene. By highlighting the importance of maternal education, the study aims to inform interventions that empower girls with the knowledge and resources needed to manage menstruation confidently and hygienically.

## Objective

* To assess the level of knowledge related to menstrual hygiene in adolescent girls of sub-urban area of Lahore, Pakistan.
* To determine the effect of mother’s education on better menstrual hygiene among teenage girls.
